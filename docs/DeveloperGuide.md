### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delmem 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Notably, the `MainWindow` also consists of two side panels `CataloguePanel` and `PersonOrdersPanel` which displays the `Catalogue` of the SweetRewards, and the orders of the selected person respectively.

`MainWindow` implements the `PersonSelectionListener` interface, and listens to when a `PersonCard` is clicked in the `PersonListPanel`. It then tells `PersonOrdersPanel` to update the orders displayed.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delmem 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delmem 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)


The `Model` component,

* stores the SweetRewards data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and the items for sale (which are contained in a `Catalogue` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team Size: 4

1. **Allow special characters in member names:** Currently, member names can only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces. This might cause problems when users want to add members that have special characters in their names such as `Tan Ye-Ming, John` or `Kumaren s/o Ramasamy`. Some special characters to be added includes apostrophes `'`, brackets `()`, hyphens `-`, slashes `/` and periods `.`.
2. **Allow numbers and special characters in item names:** Currently, item names only accept alphabetical characters. This prevents use cases such as items with quantities or special characters (E.g. `Chocolate-Chip Cookies 100g`) from being entered. We should allow alphanumeric and special characters.
3. **Have order panel of GUI update when orders are updated:** Currently, the order panel of the GUI updates only when a person card is clicked, so when users add an order to a person or clears all data using the `clear --force` command, it does not show the updated orders until a person card is clicked. To fix this, either use an `ObservableList` to store the orders of each `Person`, or have the `addorder` and `clear` command force the order display to update.
4. **Add a delete order command:** Currently, if a user accidentally adds a wrong order, the only solution is to delete the member using `delmem` and add the member back using `addmem`. This is a lot of trouble cause by a simple mistake. As such, we should have a command that allows deletion of orders, which likely works off indexing the orders of a person. For example `delorder n/John 2` deletes the second order of John 2. Of course to complement this feature, the index of orders should be displayed in the GUI. Points awarded in the deleted order should also be revoked.
5. **Allow horizontal scrolling of GUI Person Card:** Currently the person card of the GUI does not allow horizontal scrolling if the details exceed the horizontal width of the UI. This causes extra-long inputs such as a 50 character long name to be not fully visible. This would allow for extra-long inputs for the name, phone number, email address, address, and allergens of added members.
6. **Make `invalid person error` for `redeempts` more specific:** Currently the error message when a person cannot be found is `The person index provided is invalid` which is wrong because we are not using an indexing system. It should be changed to `The member <USER-ENTERED NAME> cannot be found`
7. **Make `invalid points error` for `additem` more specific:** Currently when adding an item with invalid points (E.g. `additem i/Cookies p/aa`), the error message shown is the `Invalid command format!` message, which is too general. It should be made more specific, stating the specific error of invalid points (E.g. `Invalid points per unit! Points per unit should a postive integer!`).
8. **Add index-based selection for member selection:** Currently in our `addorder`, `addpts`, `addmempts`, `redeempts` commands, we select the member based on the first member in the list whose name contains the entered string. This might prove as an issue when there are two people with the same or similar names like `Wan Lei` and `Matthew Ang Wan Lei`. If the latter is closer to the top of the list (added earlier), there will be no way to select `Wan Lei`. To prevent this, indexing selection for these commands should be added (E.g. `addorder 3 i/Cookies` would add the Cookies order to the third person in the current filtered list). This does not get rid of the current name selection, and merely introduces an alternative to member selection.

## **Appendix: Effort**

- Our project expanded to include more than one entity type. Namely, we added the `Item` entity type, which stores the
name and points per quantity for each item stored in the application.
  

- Multiple new fields were implemented to store additional information for each `Person` entity:
    - `Points`: stores the redeemable points which the member currently has. (By Kinjal)
    - `MembershipTier`: stores the current membership tier of the member. (By Khushi)
      - Later repurposed to `MembershipPoints`, after we noticed it was easier for the application to instead keep track of the
        cumulative points of the member. (By Kok Liang)
    - `Orders`: stores the previous orders (as Strings) which were made by the member. (By Billy)
      - Later enhanced to store `Item` entities.
    - Each additional field required fixing existing code which used the `Person` entity. This includes:
      - `Person` constructors
      - All/most commands which involve members e.g. `addmem`, `editmem`
      - Existing JSON storage files for testing
    - Hence, adding these fields introduced additional levels of complexity to our application.
