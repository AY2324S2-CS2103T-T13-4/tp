# 2. About SweetRewards
SweetRewards is not just a contact management tool; it's your partner in cultivating **customer loyalty and enhancing your bakery's membership program**. With SweetRewards, you can:

* **Track your bakery's catalogue**: Keep a record of all your bakes goodies and the respective points a member can earn by purchasing one.
* **Track member information**: Keep a detailed record of each member, including their name, phone number, email, address, [allergens](#6-glossary), points, membership points, [membership tier](#6-glossary), and order history.
* **Manage orders and points**: Seamlessly add orders which automatically updates customers' points to reflect customer purchases and interactions.
* **Update Membership Tiers**: Automatically elevate members' tiers based on their membership points, unlocking new rewards and benefits aligned with each tier.

## 2.1 Understanding Membership Tiers and Points System
SweetRewards features a **dual-point system** designed to enhance customer engagement and loyalty: `Points` and `Membership Points`. Each member will also fall under a `Membership Tier` that is associated with benefits and rewards.

### Points vs. Membership Points
SweetRewards employs a nuanced points system to foster both immediate and long-term customer loyalty. Below is a comparative overview of the two types of points within the program, showcasing their distinct roles:

| Attribute | `Points`                                                             | `Membership points`                                                   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose   | Serve as currency within the loyalty program for immediate rewards   | Track long-term customer engagement and determine membership tier     |
| Earning   | Earned through purchases and specific interactions within the bakery | Earned identically to Points but are cumulative and never decrease    |
| Redeeming | Can be redeemed for discounts, offers, or products                   | Not redeemable; solely influence tier status                          |
| Impact    | Affect immediate customer benefits and rewards                       | Determine the member's tier and long-term benefits within the program |
| Commands  | `addorder` increases points; `redeempoints` decreases points         | Only increased by `addorder`; unaffected by `redeempoints`            |

<div style="border: 1px solid #D1478C; margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px; background-color: #FDE4EF; color: #910D47; border-radius: 5px;">
  üßÅ <strong>Benefit:</strong> While both types of points are earned through purchases, `Points` cater to immediate gratification by being redeemable for rewards. In contrast, `Membership Points` are designed to recognize and reward the cumulative loyalty of customers, influencing their progression through the [Membership Tiers](#6-glossary) without direct redemption for goods or services.
</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid #FFA500; margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px; background-color: #FFE8B2; color: #CC6C00; border-radius: 5px;">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Warning:</strong> Ensure that the total number of points/membership points a member has remains within the safe range of 0‚Ä¶2,000,000,000 so that the program does not malfunction.
</div>


### Membership Tiers: Criteria and Benefits
Members are classified into tiers based on their accumulated membership points. Each tier unlocks distinct benefits, rewarding members for their loyalty. These benefits can be defined by you to allow flexibility with what your have to offer.

| `Membership Tier `                               | Perks                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span style="color:#E4953C">**Bronze**:</span>   | * Entry-level for all new members.<br/> * Offers basic rewards and incentives.                                              |
| <span style="color:Grey">**Silver**:</span>      | * Requires members to accumulate a specified threshold of membership points.<br/>  * Unlocks enhanced benefits and rewards. |
| <span style="color:#B5A03D">**Gold**:</span>     | * A higher tier requiring more membership points. <br/>  * Offers substantial rewards and exclusive offers.                 |
| <span style="color:#584F3F">**Platinum**:</span> | * The pinnacle of the membership hierarchy. <br/> * Members enjoy the best rewards and personalized services.               |


### Automatic Tier Updates
* Tiers are **updated automatically** as members reach the necessary membership points for each level.
* Ensures members are **rewarded seamlessly** for their loyalty and spending.

<div style="border: 1px solid #DBAE58; margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px; background-color: #FFF3E0; color: #886B00; border-radius: 5px;">
  üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> In this current iteration, the name, number and point requirement for the tiers are still in development. Hence, instead the users can change the number of points given to their item to suit their use.
</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid #D1478C; margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px; background-color: #FDE4EF; color: #910D47; border-radius: 5px;">
  üßÅ <strong>Benefit:</strong> By maintaining and upgrading membership tiers, you foster a stronger relationship with your customers, encouraging them to return to your bakery. This system not only enhances customer loyalty but also drives sales by offering tangible rewards for continued patronage.
</div>

# 4. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- **Words in `UPPER_CASE`** are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    - Example: In `add n/MEMBER_NAME`, `MEMBER_NAME` is a parameter that can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
- **Items in square brackets** are optional.
    - Example: `n/MEMBER_NAME [ag/ALLERGEN]` can be used as `n/John Doe ag/GF` or as `n/John Doe`.
- **Items followed by an ellipsis (`‚Ä¶`)** can be used multiple times, including zero times.
    - Example: `[ag/ALLERGEN]‚Ä¶` can be used as ` ` (i.e., 0 times), `ag/GF`, `ag/GF ag/LF`, etc.
- **Parameters can be in any order**.
    - Example: If the command specifies `n/MEMBER_NAME hp/MEMBER_PHONE`, using `hp/MEMBER_PHONE n/MEMBER_NAME` is also acceptable.
- **Repeat parameters** (Except for allergens) is not allowed and will result in an error.
- **Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters** (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.
    - Example: If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
- **When using a PDF version of this document**, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines, as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
- **If there is a repeat parameter**, only last parameter will be taken
  - Example: `delitem i/chocolate croissant i/kaya waffle` will only delete kaya waffle from the catalogue.
  - Exception: The `addmem` command will give an error if repeat parameters exist to help you make sure that you did not make a mistake!
- **For commands that accept partial names**, the system matches the input to the member whose name most closely resembles the provided partial name. If the partial name could refer to multiple members, the system will select the first member listed.
  - To minimize confusion and errors, it is strongly recommended to use unique, full names of members when issuing commands. This practice also helps prevent duplicating member entries with similar names.
  - Example: If there are members named `Betsy Crowead` and `Betsy Dredge`, and you issue a command for `Betsy`, the system will apply the command to the first `Betsy Crowe` listed in the member directory.
- Commands can only be in **English**

This flexibility ensures every member's loyalty is accurately recognised and rewarded.<br>
In the case of similar names like `Betsy Crowead` and `Betsy Croweas`, when adding order to `Betsy Crowe`, the order would be added to the member who was added first in the list.

# 7. FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>**
**A**: Install SweetRewards on the other computer and copy the data file from your original installation directory to the new one. This will replace the empty data file created during the new installation.

**Q: How do I manually add points to a member's account?<br>**
**A**: Use the addpts command with the member's name and the desired amount of points. For instance: addpts n/John Doe p/50 adds 50 points to John Doe's account, useful for promotional points or correcting errors.

**Q: How can I upgrade a member's tier manually?<br>**
**A**: Employ the addmempts command with the member's name and the points you want to add. For example, addmempts n/John Doe mp/400 manually awards John Doe 400 points. The membership tier of the member will be determined by the number of points they have according to the membership tier table

**Q: Is it possible to remove a member from the loyalty program?<br>**

**Q: How do membership points influence tier levels?<br>**
**A**:> Membership tiers are determined by the total accumulated membership points. Each tier requires reaching a specific points threshold, which is automatically tracked by the system. Check the "Understanding Membership Tiers and Points System" section for detailed tier requirements.

**Q: How do I handle points for cancelled orders?<br>**
**A**: For cancelled, use the `redeempoints` command to deduct the equivalent points from the member's account, keeping their points balance accurate with their actual purchases.

# 8. Troubleshooting

Facing issues with SweetRewards? Here are some common problems and how to resolve them.

## Technical Issues
**1. Application won't start<br>**
üö´ <span style="color:#D32D41">**Problem**:</span> Double-clicking the [jar file](#6-glossary) doesn‚Äôt open SweetRewards.<br>
‚úÖ <span style="color:#6AB187">**Solution**:</span> Verify that Java 11 or higher is installed. Open a command prompt, navigate to the application's directory, and type in `java -jar sweetrewards-v1.2.jar` (Note the version number might differ, use the one that is seen in the version of SweetRewards that you have downloaded) and press enter. If issues persist, re-download the [jar file](#6-glossary) to rule out corruption.


**2. [GUI](#6-glossary) opens off-screen<br>**
üö´ <span style="color:#D32D41">**Problem**:</span>  SweetRewards starts off the visible screen area when using multiple displays.<br>
‚úÖ <span style="color:#6AB187">**Solution**:</span>  Locate and delete preferences.json in the application's folder to reset window positioning, then restart the application.

## Operational Issues
**1. Incorrect Points Allocation<br>**
üö´ <span style="color:#D32D41">**Problem**:</span> Points were mistakenly added to the wrong member.<br>
‚úÖ <span style="color:#6AB187">**Solution**:</span> Use the edit command to adjust the points for both involved members. Replace the newly updated (wrong) number of points with the initial (correct) number of points and add the points for the new member again. For example, edit 2 p/50 to replace the wrongly updated points and addpoints 3 p/50 to add points to the correct member.<br>
You could also refer to the [FAQ, Question 2](#7-faq)

**2. Incorrect Member Information Entered<br>**
üö´ <span style="color:#D32D41">**Problem**:</span> Incorrect information (e.g., phone number or email) was entered for a member.<br>
‚úÖ <span style="color:#6AB187">**Solution**:</span> Correct the mistake by using the `edit` command to adjust points for both the affected and intended members, ensuring accuracy in the loyalty program.<br>


**3. Orders Not Reflecting in Member's History<br>**
üö´ <span style="color:#D32D41">**Problem**:</span>  Newly added orders are not reflected in a member's history.<br>
‚úÖ <span style="color:#6AB187">**Solution**:</span> Verify that `addorder` was used correctly, including the correct member name and order details. This ensures all transactions are accurately recorded.<br>

# 10. Planned enhancements

We understand some of our features and commands might still not be adequate for some bakeries.<br>
Not to worry! We have a comprehensive list of planned enhancements we hope to include in our future iterations which include: <br>
1. **Allow special characters in member names**: Currently, member names can only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces. This might cause problems when users want to add members that have special characters in their names such as Tan Ye-Ming, John or Kumaren s/o Ramasamy. Some special characters to be added includes apostrophes ', brackets (), hyphens -, slashes / and periods ..
2. **Allow numbers and special characters in item names**: Currently, item names only accept alphabetical characters. This prevents use cases such as items with quantities or special characters (E.g. Chocolate-Chip Cookies 100g) from being entered. We should allow alphanumeric and special characters.
3. **Have order panel of GUI update when orders are updated**: Currently, the order panel of the GUI updates only when a person card is clicked, so when users add an order to a person or clears all data using the clear --force command, it does not show the updated orders until a person card is clicked. To fix this, either use an ObservableList to store the orders of each Person, or have the addorder and clear command force the order display to update.
4. **Add a delete order command**: Currently, if a user accidentally adds a wrong order, the only solution is to delete the member using delmem and add the member back using addmem. This is a lot of trouble cause by a simple mistake. As such, we should have a command that allows deletion of orders, which likely works off indexing the orders of a person. For example delorder n/John 2 deletes the second order of John 2. Of course to complement this feature, the index of orders should be displayed in the GUI. Points awarded in the deleted order should also be revoked.
5. **Allow horizontal scrolling of GUI Person Card**: Currently the person card of the GUI does not allow horizontal scrolling if the details exceed the horizontal width of the UI. This causes extra-long inputs such as a 50 character long name to be not fully visible. This would allow for extra-long inputs for the name, phone number, email address, address, and allergens of added members.
6. **Make `invalid person error` for `redeempts` more specific**: Currently the error message when a person cannot be found is The person index provided is invalid which is wrong because we are not using an indexing system. It should be changed to The member <USER-ENTERED NAME> cannot be found
7. **Make `invalid points error` for `additem` more specific**: Currently when adding an item with invalid points (E.g. additem i/Cookies p/aa), the error message shown is the Invalid command format! message, which is too general. It should be made more specific, stating the specific error of invalid points (E.g. Invalid points per unit! Points per unit should a postive integer!).
8. **Add index-based selection for member selection**: Currently in our addorder, addpts, addmempts, redeempts commands, we select the member based on the first member in the list whose name contains the entered string. This might prove as an issue when there are two people with the same or similar names like Wan Lei and Matthew Ang Wan Lei. If the latter is closer to the top of the list (added earlier), there will be no way to select Wan Lei. To prevent this, indexing selection for these commands should be added (E.g. addorder 3 i/Cookies would add the Cookies order to the third person in the current filtered list). This does not get rid of the current name selection, and merely introduces an alternative to member selection.
