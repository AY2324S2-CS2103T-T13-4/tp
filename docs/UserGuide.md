# 2. About SweetRewards
SweetRewards is not just a contact management tool; it's your partner in cultivating **customer loyalty and enhancing your bakery's membership program**. With SweetRewards, you can:

* **Track member information**: Keep a detailed record of each member, including their name, phone number, email, address, allergens, points, membership points, membership tier, and order history.
* **Manage orders and points**: Seamlessly add orders which automatically updates customers' points to reflect customer purchases and interactions.
* **Update membership tiers**: Automatically elevate members' tiers based on their membership points, unlocking new rewards and benefits aligned with each tier.

## 2.1 Understanding Membership Tiers and Points System
SweetRewards features a dual-point system designed to enhance customer engagement and loyalty: `points` and `membership points`.

### Points vs. Membership Points
SweetRewards employs a nuanced points system to foster both immediate and long-term customer loyalty. Below is a comparative overview of the two types of points within the program, showcasing their distinct roles:

| Attribute | `Points`                                                             | `Membership points`                                                   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose   | Serve as currency within the loyalty program for immediate rewards   | Track long-term customer engagement and determine membership tier     |
| Earning   | Earned through purchases and specific interactions within the bakery | Earned identically to Points but are cumulative and never decrease    |
| Redeeming | Can be redeemed for discounts, offers, or products                   | Not redeemable; solely influence tier status                          |
| Impact    | Affect immediate customer benefits and rewards                       | Determine the member's tier and long-term benefits within the program |
| Commands  | `addorder` increases points; `redeempoints` decreases points         | Only increased by `addorder`; unaffected by `redeempoints`            |

üåü **Benefit**: While both types of points are earned through purchases, `Points` cater to immediate gratification by being redeemable for rewards. In contrast, `Membership Points` are designed to recognize and reward the cumulative loyalty of customers, influencing their progression through the membership tiers without direct redemption for goods or services.

### Membership Tiers: Criteria and Benefits
Members are classified into tiers based on their accumulated membership points. Each tier unlocks distinct benefits, rewarding members for their loyalty:

* Bronze Tier:
  * Entry-level for all new members. 
  * Offers basic rewards and incentives. 

* Silver Tier:
  * Requires members to accumulate a specified threshold of membership points. 
  * Unlocks enhanced benefits and rewards.
  
* Gold Tier:
  * A higher tier requiring more membership points. 
  * Offers substantial rewards and exclusive offers. 

* Platinum Tier:
  * The pinnacle of the membership hierarchy. 
  * Members enjoy the best rewards and personalized services. 

### Automatic Tier Updates
* Tiers are **updated automatically** as members reach the necessary membership points for each level. 
* Ensures members are **rewarded seamlessly** for their loyalty and spending.

üí° **Tip**: By understanding and utilizing the dual-point and tiered membership structure of SweetRewards, you can effectively manage your bakery's loyalty program, ensuring that your customers remain engaged and appreciated.

üåü **Benefit**: By maintaining and upgrading membership tiers, you foster a stronger relationship with your customers, encouraging them to return to your bakery. This system not only enhances customer loyalty but also drives sales by offering tangible rewards for continued patronage.

Adds an order for a specified item to an existing member in the loyalty program, automatically updating the member's current points and membership points based on the item's points.

üåü **Benefit**: Streamline the process of tracking purchases and rewarding members by using addorder to add their orders directly into the system. This automatically adjusts their points according to the purchase, fostering a more engaging loyalty experience.

Format: `addorder n/MEMBER_NAME i/ITEM_NAME [q/QUANTITY_PURCHASED]`

* ITEM_NAME will be checked in the catalogue; if it exists, the corresponding item points will be added to the member's current points and membership points.

Examples:
* `addorder n/John Doe i/Chocolate Cake q/2` Adds `2` orders of `Chocolate Cake` to `John` Doe`, updating points accordingly.

üí° **Tip**: Use unique attributes of members when adding points to avoid errors. Partial names are matched to the closest resembling member.

## 4.8 Adding points: `addpoints`

üí° **Tip**: Use the addmship command to manually adjust membership tiers in scenarios where automatic updates based on membership points might not fully capture a member's loyalty or contributions.

This flexibility ensures every member's loyalty is accurately recognized and rewarded.

## 4.11 Editing a member : `edit`

Edits an existing member in the loyalty program.

üåü **Benefit**:  Keep your customer records up-to-date with the edit command. Whether a member moves to a new address or changes their phone number, you can easily update their profile, ensuring effective communication and personalized service.

üåü **Benefit**: Quickly locate a member's details using the find command, perfect for when you need to access a customer's loyalty information during a transaction or when providing personalized customer service.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Examples:

# 7. Troubleshooting

Facing issues with SweetRewards? Here are some common problems and how to resolve them.

## Technical Issues
1. Application won't start<br>
üö´ **Problem**: Double-clicking the jar file doesn‚Äôt open SweetRewards.<br> 
‚úÖ **Solution**: Verify that Java 11 or higher is installed. Open a command prompt, navigate to the application's directory, and execute java -jar sweetrewards-v1.2.jar. If issues persist, re-download the jar file to rule out corruption.


2. GUI opens off-screen<br>
üö´ **Problem**:  SweetRewards starts off the visible screen area when using multiple displays.<br>
‚úÖ **Solution**:  Locate and delete preferences.json in the application's folder to reset window positioning, then restart the application.

## Operational Issues
1. Incorrect Points Allocation<br>
üö´ **Problem**: Points were mistakenly added to the wrong member.<br>
‚úÖ **Solution**: Use the edit command to adjust the points for both involved members. Replace the newly updated (wrong) number of points with the initial (correct) number of points and add the points for the new member again. For example, edit 2 p/50 to replace the wrongly updated points and addpoints 3 p/50 to add points to the correct member.<br>


2. Incorrect Member Information Entered<br>
üö´ **Problem**: Incorrect information (e.g., phone number or email) was entered for a member.<br>
